## Description

Don't you hate SBOXes? They are clunky, fragile, and liable to cache timing attacks.
Well, I've fixed it by removing SBOXes and replacing all operations with a non-abelian group operation! You can't do linear cryptanalysis when the cipher has nothing linear about it!

## Difficulty

Hard

## Deployment

NIL

## Solution

This challenge requires a fair amount of knowledge about the underlying group. See [solve.ipynb](./solve/solve.ipynb)
