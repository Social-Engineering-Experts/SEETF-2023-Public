## Description

It's your second semester in SEE-IA, and they're making you learn about data structures & algorithms. You don't get what it has to do with anything you'll be doing - how does capturing a bunch of escaped hackers need boring linked lists and trees? Classes are so boring, and sometimes you wish you could just drop out if the fate of the world wasn't hanging in the balance. But oh well, this is your last assignment. Better do a good job of it!
